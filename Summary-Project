"In this project, a system has been built that serves the owner of the company to record many 
projects and then add sales and purchases information for each project, where later he can 
see whether the project has won or lost, and also in another interface to explore all the data 
in a specific project, also if he no longer needs the project, he deletes it.
The system was built using the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming 
language, which is a programming language produced by Microsoft and used to develop 
programs through which you control other programs such as all Office programs, 
AutoCAD, and others.
In the system, it was used with the Excel program to give it additional power to use it to 
add new features to it and to serve the end-user with ease and comfort."
